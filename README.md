MITIGATING REASON 

V – 222400 

Validity periods must be verified on all application messages using WS-Security or SAML assertions. 

This is a security measure to prevent the use of outdated or expired security tokens. This ID would not apply on this project due to the project not having a need for security tokens &/or passwords. 

V – 222404 

The application must use both the NotBefore and NotOnOrAfter elements or OneTimeUse element when using the Conditions element in a SAML assertion. 

Specifically, it states that when using the Conditions element in a SAML assertion, the assertion must include either both the NotBefore and NotOnOrAfter elements or the Onetime Use element. For this project this would not be relevant due that SAML, it’s a secured internet connection enabler for using relevant Single Sign On on XML, this would not apply. 

V – 222612 

The application must not be vulnerable to overflow attacks. 

To mitigate the risk of overflow attacks, we would need to employ secure coding practices and implement proper input validation, boundary checking, and memory management. Overflow attacks, such as   buffer overflows, can lead to serious security vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to overwrite memory and execute arbitrary code.  

Here are some best practices to prevent overflow attacks: 

 Input Validation   

Buffer Size Checks  

Secure Coding Practices 

Memory Safety Languages 

 Static Code Analysis 

 Dynamic Analysis 

V – 222578 

The application must destroy the session ID value and/or cookie on logoff or browser close. 

 

V – 222430 

The application must execute without excessive account permissions. 

In this scenario where the application is used locally in a browser like Mozilla Firefox and doesn't connect to the internet, managing session IDs and cookies for local security is still important. Even in a local context, it's crucial to follow secure practices to protect sensitive information and user sessions.  

Here are some considerations that would help to mitigate this STIG:  

Session Management  

Cookie Attributes (‘HTTP Only’, ‘Same Site’) 

Session Timeout  

Clear Cookies on browser close  

Secure local storage 

V – 222432 

The application must enforce the limit of three consecutive invalid logon attempts by a user during a 15-minute time period. 

ARCANA application does not need user/password requirement, this STIG is not relevant for this project. 

V – 222577 

The application must not expose session IDs.  

It's crucial to implement measures to prevent session ID exposure, as exposing session IDs can lead to security vulnerabilities. Here are some best practices to ensure that session IDs are not exposed:  

Protect against session fixation 

Session ID rotation  

Session timeout  

Use secure cookies 

V – 222609 

The application must not be subject to input handling vulnerabilities.  

To mitigate input handling vulnerabilities in the application, we need to implement robust input validation, sanitization, and encoding practices. Here are some recommendations to address input handling vulnerabilities:  

Avoid trusting user input  

Use parameterized queries  

File upload security (valid file types and restrict size) 

Error Handling 

Input Validation 

V – 222608 

The application must not be vulnerable to XML-oriented attacks 

To mitigate XML-oriented attacks in the application, even if it's not connected to the internet, we can implement the following measures:  

Avoid XML External Entity Attacks  

Use a secure XML Parser  

Input validation for XML Data 

V – 222602 

The application must protect from Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities 

To mitigate Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the locally run application, follow these best practices:  

Output encoding  

Content Security Policy (CSP)  

Use frameworks with built-in protection (e.g. React, Angular, Vue...)  

Escape Dynamic JavaScript values 

V – 222601 

The application must not store sensitive information in hidden fields 

To ensure that your application does not store sensitive information in hidden fields, we can follow these best practices:  

Avoid Storing Sensitive Data  

Secure Communication Channels  

Use local storage  

Data Masking 

V – 222607 

The application must not be vulnerable to SQL Injection. 

Even though MongoDB is a NoSQL database and not susceptible to traditional SQL injection attacks, it's crucial to follow best practices to prevent NoSQL injection or other security vulnerabilities. Here are some recommendations to mitigate this:  

Use parameterized queries  

Sanitize input  

Error Handling  

Update dependencies 

V – 222604 

The application must be protected from command injection. 

To protect the application from command injection vulnerabilities, especially in the context of using MongoDB, we can follow these best practices to mitigate this:  

Use parameterized queries  

Sanitize input  

Error Handling  

Update dependencies 

V – 222403 

The application must use the NotOnOrAfter condition when using the SubjectConfirmation element in a SAML assertion. 

Same as with V-222400 and V- 222404 this would not apply to this project due to the project not requiring any kind of authentication, SSO or such 

V – 222585 

The application must fail to a secure state if system initialization fails, shutdown fails, or aborts fail. 

Ensuring that the application fails to a secure state in the event of various failures involves implementing robust error handling and recovery mechanisms. Here are some guidelines to achieve this:  

Error handling  

Graceful initialization  

Shutdown process  

Abort handling  

Testing Scenarios 

V – 222550 

The application, when utilizing PKI-based authentication, must validate certificates by constructing a certification path to an accepted trust anchor. 

The application does not need any kind of authentication/certification use, this would not apply for this project. 

V – 222522 

The application must uniquely identify and authenticate organizational users (or processes acting on behalf of organizational users). 

The application does not need any kind of authentication, but the application to mitigate this is using the user's requirement for their initials to recognize who did what. 

V – 222554 

The application must not display passwords/PINs as clear text. 

This application will have no usage for passwords 

V – 222596 

The application must protect the confidentiality and integrity of transmitted information. 

This application will have no usage for passwords 

V – 222399 

Messages protected with WS_Security must use time stamps with creation and expiration times. 

N/A; ARCANA will not use WS_Security tokens.
