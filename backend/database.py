# It seems like there is functionality shared between file and the database_manager
# I'm not really sure if one is correct or wrong but the differences should be outlined
# in some way; the particular purpose of this file and its context should be describe
# here. Describing every little thing in every method is not nessecery, however, global
# variables that are being used throughout the class should be elaborated on in terms of
# what they are and what they do for the class.
