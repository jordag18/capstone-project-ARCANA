This folder would normally contain logs from the Blue Team and screenshots of their SIEM or similar tools to verify that they have successfully prevented/mitigated a cyber threat or restored a system that was the target of a cyber threat. Due to security constraints, no files have been provided nor will they be provided in the future. Good news is that the context within those tools will typically be provided within observer logs that are located in the analyst initials folders within pdrr/white :-)
